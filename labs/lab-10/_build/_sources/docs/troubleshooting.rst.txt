Troubleshooting
===============
This section describes some common issues that can arise and possible solutions.

Issue #1
--------
In Lab 3, I originally did not understand how to set up a virtual environment.
After better understanding the terminal and git bash commands, it was a breeze. Literally use it every lab.

Issue #2
--------
In Lab 9, I had a hard time understanding what exactly we should do to 'test' the code. 
After troubleshooting a lot (lol), I eventually took off of the example and changed some of the terms, such as changing insert to select or delete.

Issue #3
--------
In lab 10, I had orginally been clueless!
I had no choice but to do the only sensible thing......read the directions!!!!
